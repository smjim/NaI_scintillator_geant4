# Simulation of NaI scintillator coupled to PMT

UCNProBe

# DONE:
 - Scintillation of NaI crystal
 - Optical transport within crystal and off Reflectix lining
 - "PMT" detection of optical photons and output to root file
 - Energy output and others, but energy seems to be weird(?)

# TODO:
 - More crystals (put together all 16 for ProBe)
 - More realistic detection 
 - Try to make simulation realistic enough to do gamma spectroscopy
 - (2) Radiation source instead of (alternative to) particle gun
 - (3) Once simulation can be compared to real life, make sure parameters and simulation is as accurate as possible from first principles
